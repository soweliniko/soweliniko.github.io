<h2 id="looptober">Looptober</h2>
<p>In October 2021 I made a short piece of music every day for the #looptober creative challenge on mastodon. I've put all my loops in a zip file, along with a text file containing the mastodon posts they are from, for some additional context. It's a real mix of stuff, some better and some worse, but I hope you enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="songaweek">songaweek</h2>
<p>A while ago I joined #songaweek on tilde.town IRC to try and challenge myself to actually release music, and make some things that are different to what I often do. Here are things I made for it:</p>
<p><a href="./music/chip.mp3">a dance-y chiptune sketch (week of 2021-09-13)</a></p>
<p><a href="./music/thumbnail.mp3">Louie Zong - Thumbnail (bass cover) (week of 2021-08-20)</a></p>
<h2 id="jams">jams</h2>
<p>Random jams. Top is most recent.</p>
