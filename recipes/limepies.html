  <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>190 g vegan graham cracker or digestive biscuit crumbs</li>
<li>60 g vegan butter (melted // such as Earth Balance)</li>
<li>120 g raw cashews (soaked for 4-6 hours or overnight, then drained)</li>
<li>180 ml light or full-fat coconut milk (well shaken)</li>
<li>60 ml coconut oil (melted)</li>
<li>3-4 large limes, juiced (3-4 limes yield ~1/2 cup juice)</li>
<li>1 Tbsp lime zest</li>
<li>80-120 ml agave nectar/maple syrup (depending on preferred sweetness)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add graham crackers to a food processor and process until you achieve a fine meal. Then add melted butter and pulse to combine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribute evenly among muffin tins and press down with a glass or spoon to flatten. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and set aside to cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add all filling ingredients to a blender and blend on high (or liquefy) until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime zest/juice for more tart, or more agave for added sweetness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour filling into muffin tins and tap on counter to release air bubbles. Top with a bit more lime zest and loosely cover.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Freeze for 2-4 hours or until firm. Remove from the freezer for 10-15 minutes to thaw before serving. Will keep covered in the freezer for up to 2 weeks, though best when fresh.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>These are very, very good. Too good, in fact. Difficult to stop eating. I made them with digestives because you can't get graham crackers in the UK.</p>
