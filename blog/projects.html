  <p>I've been wanting to blog more about projects I've done and how I did them, sharing those creative things, but I've run into a few problems  that make me unsure if doing so is worth it.</p>
<p>Firstly, that most of my projects are things that feel fun to me but are actually very boring when I think about them (like the project that prompted this post, my new dance game setup, the main parts of which were making a foam mat and a small bracket). There's not much to actually talk about with these things, other than &quot;look I made a thing&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, most of my projects are very situational - it's not a case of &quot;here is an [x] you can make&quot; but rather &quot;I was in situation [x] and wanted a [y] so I made one&quot;. These things are often made using scrap materials from other things, or are only possible becuase of other things happening to be the way they are in my life. So I can't really write anything like a tutorial or even say what kind of wood I used for [x] because I literally don't know: it's scrap material.</p>
<p>Is there any value to posts about projects like this?</p>
<p>if you have any thoughts , contact me on mastodon @nihilazo@tiny.tilde.website or via email to nico at itwont dot work</p>
