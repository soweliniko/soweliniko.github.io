  <p>I got a box of an assortment of different teas and infusions for Christmas. Over the 12 days of Christmas (entirely coincidentally, as it turns out) I tasted all of these. Here's my opinions on them all and a TIER LIST (because Gemini needed tier list content). All teas are from twinings. (the tier list is using abbreviated names because some of these blends have very long names)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>A: Jasmine, Earl Grey
B: Pure Green
C: Turmeric, Everyday
D: Citrus and ginger, cranberry and lime, lemon and ginger
E: Beetroot
F: &#34;Glow&#34;, Strawberry and Raspberry, Peppermint

<ul>
<li>
<p>Day 1: Earl Grey. Strong citrus-y vibe. I like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 2: Jasmine Tea. Subtle, maybe I could do with letting it steep a bit longer, but I like it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 3: Twinings &quot;Glow&quot; green tea with strawberry and cucumber.
Smells like strawberry sweets. tastes like weirdness with an overtone of very fake-tasting strawberry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 4: Turmeric with orange and star anice infusion. It's not bad, tastes a bit spicy and orange-y, works well enough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 5: strawberry and raspberry infusion. smells nice, taste just kinda doesn't work for me, doesn't taste like strawberry and raspberry, just tastes weird.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 6: pure green tea. I feel like I can't dislike this, but I also don't especially like it. It's just there. Not got that much to it I feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 7: Twining's everyday tea. it's a cup of tea the way that brits do a cup of tea normally. Meh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 8: green tea with citrus and ginger. tastes kinda like unmedicated lemsip but subtler in a way. I don't hate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 9: green tea with cranberry and lime. not terrible, I prefer just a normal green tea or jasmine tea tho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 10: lemon and ginger. more lemsip!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 11: beetroot with ginger and orange. it's meh, I mostly taste the orange, I could drink it but I'm not a fan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I guess I like tea teas (green teas and black teas) more than I like fruity/herbal-y infusions (which tend to be marketed for their health properties more than their taste) in general, and adding overwhelming fruity/herbally stuff to green tea I'm not a fan of either. Jasmine tea and earl grey are both nice. I want to try more different black/green teas now but I kinda know where I am with finding stuff to try.</p>
<p>If anybody here has some teas to suggest me based on this list (or in general), hmu. I'd love some good tea recommendations.</p>
