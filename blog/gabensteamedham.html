<p><b>Mwu:</b> Hey! Since writing this nico got its Steam Deck working, and now feels much more <a href="../blog/steam-deck-redemption.html">positive about it</a> !</p>
</div>

<p>I really wanted to love the Steam Deck (or as I am going to probably accidentally call it many times in this post, the Steamed Ham, as I took to calling it through this experience). I really did. It was a relatively elegant, self-contained solution to wanting something to play PC games on that my thinkpad couldn&rsquo;t handle. I wanted this post to be a review of the steam deck, diving into some of the technical aspects of the machine and how I felt about it after a thorough proper try. But sadly my steam deck adventure didn&rsquo;t get that far. It barely got to the first level of portal.</p>
<p>I bought a 64gb steam deck right after Christmas, it took a while to arrive but that was expected given it was the holiday season. I excitedly got it out of the box, plugged it in, turned it on, and failed to connect to wifi. Then got through that and tried to launch a game. It didn&rsquo;t launch. Tried a verified game. It didn&rsquo;t launch. Tried Aperture Desk Job, the official pack in/test game (also borked). Then I tried to shut it down and it didn&rsquo;t even shut down, rebooting instead(?). The buttons didn&rsquo;t work all the time. It would freeze up and get stuck on things. It was a broken buggy mess. I was so disappointed in it that I actually broke down crying. So I contacted steam support.</p>
<p>Steam support were very helpful and after going through some software troubleshooting steps they sent me a return label, so I sent my deck off for a return. 2 weeks later, I got a replacement!</p>
<p>Things started well. Well, they started ok. I played through the entirety of aperture desk job, with only a little bit of suspicious Gyro aim weirdness. I played some other games for a little bit and the worked fine! So I put in my SD card only to get a mysterious &ldquo;error 2&rdquo; on trying to format it. Fine, it&rsquo;s still a little janky, I formatted it in my PC. I then tried to download and play some other games, and the wifi was <em>still</em> fucked. The on screen keyboard would stop responding to keypresses randomly. The Gyro was weird and messy and not working properly in every game I tested.</p>
<p>It was broken.</p>
<p>At this point my feelings were something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOOOO STEAMED HAM! PLEASE! STEAMED HAM! YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DISAPPOINT ME LIKE THIS??? COME ON STEAMED HAM!!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After two failed attempts, I gave up. I asked for a refund.</p>
<p>I really wanted this to work out. It was, theoretically speaking, my perfect gaming device. But reality said otherwise.</p>
<p>So what do I have to say really? Nothing. Just wanted to vent. Valve need better QA. Props to support for being mostly cool though.</p>
<p>Well Gaben, you are an odd fellow, but I have to say: you steamed some bad hams.</p>
