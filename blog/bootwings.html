<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that in 2022 I want to learn to sew better, using the sewing machine I got towards the end of 2021. Since I started at my current college I&rsquo;ve had a friend who&rsquo;s look I am not even subtle about the fact I&rsquo;m trying to steal, and she has some awesome boots that have bat wings on them. They came from a brand called Koi Footwear, who are wayyy out of my price range. So I decided to make my own!</p>
<p>This was my second real sewing project and one that was probably more difficult than I thought it would be, but I learned a bunch of stuff. Initially I was gonna make this a tutorial but instead I&rsquo;ll just write a post about how I made it, and you can use that as a tutorial if you want. But you probably shouldn&rsquo;t - the fact my needle gets unthreaded as soon as I finish a single line of stitching should tell you how competent I am as a sewer.</p>
<p>First, I drew up a pattern in inkscape based on some images from koi&rsquo;s site.</p>
<p><a href="../images/wings/wings.svg">The pattern</a></p>
<p>Then I printed this pattern and cut it out of a sheet of vinyl faux leather. I cut the fabric two layers at a time with right sides together to ensure I had two very similar pieces for each side when I was sewing. This was a little bit wasteful of fabric but made sewing a LOT easier. I didn&rsquo;t have any pattern weights and my weak pins wouldn&rsquo;t go through the vinyl without bending, so I used blue tack to hold the pattern in place.</p>
<p><img src="../images/wings/1.jpg" alt="Image: A sheet of faux-leather fabric with a bat wing pattern stuck to it and another bat-wing shaped piece of the same pattern"></p>
<p>Once these were cut, keeping the right sides together, I sewed around the edge of the pieces using a leather needle and walking foot (two things I would NEVER try sewing vinyl without), leaving the long straight side open. I discovered that I&rsquo;d missed some spots here and I had to re-sew them, which lead to some problems in the results, but nothing super major.</p>
<p><img src="../images/wings/2.jpg" alt="Image: Two bat-wing shaped pieces of fabric sewn together"></p>
<p>Then I turned them inside out (something that vinyl hates doing, I enlisted a wooden spoon and pencil as makeshift tools to help me turn it out) and sewed across the open seam.</p>
<p><img src="../images/wings/3.jpg" alt="Image: Two roughly wing-shaped fabric objects"></p>
<p>I then &ldquo;pressed&rdquo; the pieces (under a pile of D&amp;D books, as I don&rsquo;t have the proper tools for that) and sewed some decorative extra lines (roughly following the pattern, but it was largely freehand) and punched through no-sew eyelets to allow me to lace them into my boots. The lines start a bit out from the edge of the fabric as my sewing machine couldn&rsquo;t sew through the bulky seams. Punching the eyelet holes was fun but I didn&rsquo;t get them exactly lined up.</p>
<p><img src="../images/wings/4.jpg" alt="Image: two fabric bat wings with eyelet fasteners on one side"></p>
<p>When this was done, I attached them to my boots, and there it is! The winged boots in the first picture.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m happy with this project. I should have known earlier about the problems that sewing vinyl can have, and be more careful to actually catch both pieces of something together when sewing them. But I&rsquo;m very happy with them for a second ever sewing project!</p>
