1984 is a classic for a reason. It&#39;s often misunderstood or its political and philosophical commentary is taken at such a surface level it gets stripped of meaning, but this is a very good book that is well worth reading. It&#39;s a cliche to say that this book is &quot;only getting more relevant&quot;, but that&#39;s because it feels true." />

<p>1984 is a classic for a reason. It's often misunderstood or its political and philosophical commentary is taken at such a surface level it gets stripped of meaning, but this is a very good book that is well worth reading. It's a cliche to say that this book is &quot;only getting more relevant&quot;, but that's because it feels true. 1984 has important things to say on politics, epistemology, love, human nature, and the nature of power, while still being an engaging and well-written story with a strong plot and good characters.</p>
