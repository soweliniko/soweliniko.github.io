<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I feel about this book. On the one hand, it was an interesting read, and certainly from it I learned how to use the zettelkasten (and I have started doing so), Although so far I&rsquo;ve found that many of my notes just don&rsquo;t fit the format at all, as most are project specific (which are to be kept seperately).  Almost all of the practical information is this book is focused in the first 5 or so chapters. The rest is an interesting deeper look into how and why the zettelkasten works, but it is less &ldquo;how to take smart notes&rdquo; and more of a &ldquo;why these notes are smart&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d recommend this book, but I&rsquo;d recommend deeply reading the first few chapters, then skimming the rest. It&rsquo;s interesting, but if what you came for is to learn the method, it&rsquo;s largely redundant or adds a little value for a lot of explanation. Zettelkasten is, in a way, too simple a system to write a whole book about.</p>
