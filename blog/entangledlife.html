This book is a very compelling book that is a good introduction to the world of mycology - at least, an introduction that has got me so interested that it&#39;s opened up this entire new field of fascination to me (especially radical mycology) that I had absolutely no interest in before." />

<p>This book is a very compelling book that is a good introduction to the world of mycology - at least, an introduction that has got me so interested that it's opened up this entire new field of fascination to me (especially radical mycology) that I had absolutely no interest in before. 100% recommended.</p>
