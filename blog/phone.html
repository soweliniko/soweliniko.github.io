  <p>So I recently moved to using a smartphone after being a basic-phone only person for multiple years, and my experience has been actually positive. To the point where I would write a provocatively titled blog post about it for the clicks from annoyed FOSS and permacomputing people at me liking an objectively trash device. And yes, smartphones are objectively trash. They&rsquo;re hard to repair, built for minimum life and maximum profit, and generally suck (as all devices invented by modern capitalism do). But after having lived without one for so long, I want to talk about having one again.</p>
<p>I got rid of my smartphone, a Nexus 5, originally, probably sometime around 2017? I honestly don&rsquo;t remember. It&rsquo;s your usual story - found myself distracted by social media, hurt by FoMo and tracking, wanting to &ldquo;digital detox&rdquo; and take control back of my life. I did this by stopping using a smartphone entirely. (looking back, the smartphone wasn&rsquo;t the problem, as there were wider issues in my internet usage at the time). But the phone got ditched, and I developed a new approach: each device should do one thing and do it well. Phone is seperate from MP3 player, MP3 player is seperate to camera, etc. I largely still believe in this and would probably return to it, expect for one thing: I got a smartphone again. Specifically, I got the same smartphone again - my old Nexus, which was my sister&rsquo;s for a while. Now it&rsquo;s mine again.</p>
<p>After my most recent MP3 player died, I was out looking for a replacement. I thought about buying an ipod, but I then found my old smartphone in a drawer. I charged it up thinking it was broken (the screen was already a bit cracked, and I have vague memories of my sister throwing it out), then it turned out - it works! So I started using it as an mp3 player, and very soon after as a phone as well, because I may as well put a SIM in the thing if I&rsquo;m carrying it already. But it needed some things to make it good.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-smartphone-good">How to make a smartphone good</h2>
<p>Out of the box, smartphones are corporate tracking devices that hate you. So you need to take some basic steps to make them better:</p>
<ul>
<li>install a custom ROM with no gapps. This will remove 99% of the bullshit straight off the bat.</li>
<li>install fdroid, a source of reasonably decent apps</li>
<li>keep any and all social media off it.</li>
<li>keep it mostly offline. I am on a data connection that is metered by the megabyte, and only go online on wifi to download apps. I only use mobile data for things like live bus times.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps basically convert a smartphone from being a corporate tracking device to being a small, media-focused portable computer running a kinda shitty OS. My daily usage of this phone now mostly revolves around listening to my local music library and podcasts (which I copy onto it from my PC), sometimes checking one website for bus times, and sending the occasional text.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<ul>
<li>I now have a device that I can use to access live bus times while I&rsquo;m standing at a bus stop with no wifi and the last bus didn&rsquo;t arrive</li>
<li>I only have to carry one thing and it is a perfectly servicable portable media player, phone, and (in a pinch) web browser</li>
<li>the android (7, what my phone runs) UI is very nice and feels a lot better to use than a lot of dedicated device UIs (why do feature phone UIs have to suck?)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Touchscreen-only input sucks, especially for a music player where I want some more easy-access control while it&rsquo;s in my pocket without buying earbuds with a remote</li>
<li>I feel like it&rsquo;s constantly on the verge of breaking, especially because I&rsquo;m using a 9 year old model that already has a cracked screen</li>
<li>it uses MTP for file transfer which doesn&rsquo;t work super well in linux</li>
<li>people think I can get instagram now</li>
<li>people have gone from respecting me for not having a smartphone to laughing at me for having a shitty smartphone</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h2>
<ul>
<li>Android. The UI is nice but the developer side of things is a mess. Would be nice to have a nicer OS, but I also cannot think of any that is better.</li>
<li>the screen on mine, because it is cracked</li>
<li>relying on micro-USB, a very flaky and unreliable connector (although newer phones use USB-C, which is less ugly)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having a smartphone is convenient. The user experience and flexibility are nice. You have to disable a lot of stuff to make it good, but when it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s pretty good. Still not better than dedicated devices, but a whole lot more convenient. A portable computer actually made to be good (repairable, having a good OS, etc) would be far better, but smartphones are what exist, and having some kind of semi-flexible pocket media player with internet access is good.</p>
<p>so, to complete this post&rsquo;s title: &ldquo;Smartphones are good, actually, when you run a degoogled OS, keep them mostly offline, got one for basically free, and use it as a souped up MP3 player&rdquo;. I hope that you enjoyed this shameless nonsense. Back to your regularly unscheduled somewhat shameful nonsense soon.</p>
